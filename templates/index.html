    <h1>PDF Receipt Data Extractor</h1>
    <p>August 26, 2021</p>
    <p>As far as I know, Ontario Health generates two kinds of PDF receipts:</p>
    <ol>
            <li>One generated at vaccination time, that's emailed. This is a simple PDF file.</li>
            <li>One that can be generated and downloaded by visiting the <a href="https://covid19.ontariohealth.ca/">Ontario COVID-19 vaccination service</a> website.  This version is a 'duplicate' with a watermark. This is also digitally signed using the Government of Ontario's PKI but it's impossible to validate the signature outside of the Government of Ontario.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This tool simply takes a PDF file, and returns JSON with some data extracted from it, if it appears to be a valid receipt from Ontario Health. Please keep in mind that this is crude "reverse engineering" based on a small sample of valid receipts  and that receipts can be forged.</p>
